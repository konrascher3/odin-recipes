                <li>40g fresh chives, finely chopped</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>STEPS</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Lay down about 6 feet (1.8 meters) of tinfoil on a flat surface. Place place 4 clusters of 2 lasagna noodles towards the left half of the foil sheet, leaving about a ½-inch (1 cm) gap in between each cluster.</li>
                <li>Fold the right half of foil over the noodles, pressing flat. To help you see where the noodles are, run your finger along the edges of the noodles to create a rough outline in the foil.</li>
                <li>Fold the top and bottom flaps of foil over, creasing and pressing flat.</li>
                <li>Flip the foil sheet onto the table so that it’s now standing, then arrange into a square box, using the 4 groups of noodles as a visual guide. Fold and crease over any excess foil to join the ends together, then set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the flour, cooking until the mixture reaches a light golden color.</li>
                <li>Slowly drizzle in the milk and bring to a boil, whisking constantly until smooth. Mix in salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Transfer the béchamel to a large bowl and press plastic wrap onto the surface of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a very large pot over high heat. Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the onions, carrots, and celery and cook until the vegetables have started to sweat but aren’t browning.</li>
                <li>Add in the ground beef and use a wooden spoon or spatula to break up the meat into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Cook the beef, stirring occasionally, until half of the liquid has evaporated.</li>
                <li>Add in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, chicken stock, salt, and pepper, stirring to combine evenly and breaking up any last lumps.</li>
                <li>Turn down the heat to low, and simmer, covered, for about 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, line a greased 9x9-inch (23x23-cm) square baking pan with 2 sheets of foil that extend over the sides.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of béchamel on the lined baking pan and top with 2 lasagna noodles. Spread a thin layer of meat sauce evenly across the noodles, followed by a thin layer of béchamel. Repeat the layering process, following the order of: 2 noodles, meat sauce, and béchamel. Alternate the direction of the lasagna sheets after every layer.</li>
                <li>After 50 layers, place the foil box over the lasagna, helping it stay upright and stable.</li>
                <li>Continue with the layering process until the 99th layer.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Parmesan on top, then cover the whole lasagna with foil.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 1½ hours, uncovering the foil halfway, until the top is a deep golden brown.</li>
                <li>Cool for at least 2 hours, then carefully lift out the lasagna with the foil sleeves onto a large cutting board.</li>
                <li>Peel away the foil walls, then sprinkle the top of the lasagna generously with chives.</li>
                <li>Cut and serve.</li>
                <li>Book an appointment at your trusted cardiologist.</li>
