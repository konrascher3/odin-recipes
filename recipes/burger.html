            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>3 pounds ground beef</li>
                <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 ponds sliced cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 large boule, halved</li>
                <li>2 cup romaine lettuce</li>
                <li>ketchup</li>
                <li>mustard</li>
                <li>2 large tomatoes, sliced</li>
                <li>1 cup pickle coins</li>
                <li>Baked French fries, for serving (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>STEPS</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350° and line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Spray foil with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic and season with salt and pepper. Mix with your hands until evenly combined.</li>
                <li>Transfer meat mixture to the prepared baking sheet and form the mass into an extra large patty. It should be about 1” bigger in diameter than your bread. Bake until the meat is browned and cooked through, 50 to 55 minutes.</li>
                <li>Using paper towels, blot extra grease off and around the patty. Preheat broiler. Cover the entire top of the patty with cheese and broil until cheese is melty, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Assemble burger: Place bottom half of the boule bread on a large serving tray. Top with lettuce then place the giant cooked patty on top. Squeeze ketchup and mustard all over patty, then top with tomatoes and pickles and place top half of boule on top.</li>
                <li>Slice into wedges and serve warm with French fries.</li>
            </ol>
